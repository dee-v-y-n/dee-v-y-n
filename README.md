## Hi there, I'm Dee

I’m quietly building my world in tech — one project at a time 💻  
Sometimes I break things. Sometimes I fix them. But I always learn. ✨

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Web development (HTML & CSS)
- Bash and command-line tools
- Creating clean, fun, and functional digital things

## 💡 Fun Facts
- I learn best by *watching*, *listening*, and *trying things hands-on*
- I’m a night owl who codes with chill music or no sound at all 😌
- I believe in soft work with strong results 💅🏽

## 🧠 Goals
- Keep learning and showing up
- Build cool projects I’m proud of
- Grow quietly, glow loudly
